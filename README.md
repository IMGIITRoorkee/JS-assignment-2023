# JS-assignment-2023
Create a game using html, css and pure javascript. All source files should be contained in a folder named : ${game title}-${your name} Eg. flappybird-varsha

## Instructions for adding your game are as follows:
1. Create a new branch of your name.
2. All your work should be in the new branch created (Note: do not alter code of any other branch)
3. Once you are done with your work, raise a pull request from your branch to master branch and ask any of the seniors to review and merge your work into master. (Note: before you raise a PR, make sure that you merge/rebase master's commits into yours i.e your branch should not be behind master)
