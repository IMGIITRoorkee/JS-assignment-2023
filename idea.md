Got the game idea. Yayy meeee.
Random stones will come at a player from a catapult(Computer) and the player has to neutralize them. At max three hits after which the game ends. The difficulty can be changed from easy, medium and hard.

Lesssgooooooo
1. Place smtg like start playing and then the game starts.
Implementation-
On clicking start, that part shud go away and the game screen shud start up.
